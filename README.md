# Full screen landing page image.

This is how I learned to make a full screen landing page image. This could more or less work with any html element, 
put i'm pretty sure that one could apply the styles to anything else. 

To get this to work, create a div element with the id of "stage", `<div id="stage"></div>`. You can put additional information in the div element link any other tag if you'd like.

That's really all of the HTML that you need.
